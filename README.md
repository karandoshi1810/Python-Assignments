# Python-Assignments
This repository consists of the python assignments done assigned by Kapil Sir during Lock Down.
Assignment-1: This assignment has programs based on file handling operations:
               -> Open file: If a file needs to be opened in order
                              to perform operations then this 
                              command is used.
                  Syntax:file_object = open("file_name.txt","w/r/a")
                  
               -> Close file: In order to write the data in the file
                              the file needs to be closed first then
                              and only then the data will be copied in
                              the file, else it will be stored in buffer
                              and nothing will be printed in file.
                  Syntax:file.close()
                  
               -> Read file: If we only want to read the data from the
                             file and nothing needs to be written in it
                             then file should be opened in read mode.
                  Syntax:file_object = open("file_name.txt","r")
                  
               -> Write in file: If we only want to read the data from the
                                 file and nothing needs to be written in it
                                 then file should be opened in read mode.
                  Syntax:file_object = open("file_name.txt","w")
                  
               -> Append in file: If a file is already created and
                                  one does not want to erase the 
                                  contents of file and want to add/write 
                                  something in that file thenfile is opend 
                                  in append mode.
                  Syntax:file.open("name.txt","a")
 
 
Assignment-2: This assignment has programs based on some computations based on file handling in python like:
             -> Practical-1: In this program I am reading contents of
                             file which has information about computations
                             to be performed along with the data in that 
                             line and I need to perform all the defined 
                             computations.
             ->Practical-2: In this program I am given a file of student 
                            with data in the format of:
                               Name Sub1, Sub2, Sub3
                             in which 'Name' is the name of student, 
                             'Sub1' is marks of students in Subject 1
                             'Sub2' is marks of students in Subject 2
                             'Sub3' is marks of students in Subject 3.
                            My task is to check the number of students that
                            passed and failed and to get a student who stands
                            1st in classs. All this data is finally needs to be 
                            written in file named "Output.txt"
 
 
Assignment-3(Part-1): This file contains programs based on practical implemtations
                      of file handling and data structure of Python like Lists.
                      
Assignment-3(Part-2): This file conatins programs based on loops Lists, loops
                      and File Handling
                      
                      
Stack: This file contains program which is developed for practical
       implementation of using data structure list. It is menu driven
       program which can perform operations like:
       ->Insert: This operation inserts an element in the stack if 
                 and only if there is atleast one space is not filled.
                 Else it will not allow user to do this operation
       ->Pop: This operation deletes one element from top of the stack or
              it will delete last entered element in the stack. It also checks
              that there is atleast one element in the stack to do this
              operation on stack.
       ->Peep: This operation displays top element of the stack or the latest
               entered element of the stack. It also checks that there is atleast 
               one element in the stack to do this operation on stack.
       ->isEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty or not. It will return only boolean
                   values.
       ->isFull: Checks if the stack is yet fukk or not. It will return only boolean
                   values.
       ->Empty Stack: This operation will pop the elements of the stack untill it is
                       empty. It will also check that before performing this operation
                       whether the stack has atleast one element.
       ->Total Elements: This operation will return total number of elements currently
                          present in the stack.
